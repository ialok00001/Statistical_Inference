# Statistical_Inference

This is a project on performing some statistical inferences on a Mobile phones [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmars1010/filpkart-mobiles) in R.

Here, we have:
1) Employed preprocessing strategies to the data
2) Created visualization plots using ggplot2 and other libraries
3) Stated inferences based on visual understanding from these plots
4) Found out the outliers and mistakes in the data, which became evident from the graphs
5) Developed models on some of the variables, even in different scales
6) Performed statistical tests on the assumptions of these models

We could have done much more. But the project had become so long, that we decided to end it here.
